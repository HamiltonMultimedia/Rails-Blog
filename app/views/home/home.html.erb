            <p class="col-md-12 fs-4 fw-lighter"> Confession: My actual blog is named "<a href="https://terencehamilton.com/category/my-runbook/" target="_blank">My Runbook</a>" and is located <a href="https://terencehamilton.com/category/my-runbook/" target="_blank">here</a>. I've written a blog post about my experience in building this site there. You may have found this site from there.
            </p>
            <p class="col-md-12 fs-4 fw-lighter">I built this website because I wanted to match the skills listed on a job posting I saw. Here's a link to the <a href="https://github.com/HamiltonMultimedia/Rails-Blog" target="_blank">code</a>! I haven't applied for it yet. I'll let you know if I get the job. Lol. Also, I saw an opportunity to learn a new skill, Ruby on Rails programming. This project allows me to throw that skill on my resume! ðŸ˜Ž

            <p class="col-md-12 fs-4 fw-lighter" This website was created using Ruby on Rails. Ruby is the programming language that allows you to create objects and make them do things programmatically.<br>
                Rails is the framework that runs your Ruby programs and allows you to create systems with them alot faster and it makes the workflow more efficient than any other framework I have ever seen.
