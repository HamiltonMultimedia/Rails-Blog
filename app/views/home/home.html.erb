            <p class="col-md-8 fs-4 fw-lighter">I built this website because I wanted to match the skills listed on a job posting I saw. I haven't applied yet. I'll let you know if I get the job. Lol. Also, I saw an opportunity to learn a new skill, Ruby on Rails programming. This project allows me to throw that skill on my resume! ðŸ˜Ž

            <p class="col-md-8 fs-4 fw-lighter">This website was created using Ruby on Rails. Ruby is the programming language that allows you to create objects and make them do things programmatically.<br><br>
                Rails is the framework that runs your Ruby programs and allows you to create systems with them alot faster and it makes the workflow more efficient than any other framework I have ever seen.
