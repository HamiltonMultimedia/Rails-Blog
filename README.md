I built this website because I wanted to match the skills listed on a job posting I saw recently. Also, I saw this as an opportunity to kick my portfolio up a notch!
This is my 1st attempt at a Ruby on Rails app and it seems to have been quite successful!

Ruby is the programming language that allows you to create objects and make them do things programmatically.

Rails is the framework that runs your Ruby programs and allows you to create systems with them alot faster and it makes the workflow more efficient than any other framework I have ever seen.

I'm using Terraform for IaC and a Ubuntu Linode for hosting. (I did it the hard way...LOL).
