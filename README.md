I built this <a href="https://rails-blog.terencehamilton.com" target="_blank">website</a> because I wanted to match the skills listed on a job posting I saw recently. Also, I saw this as an opportunity to kick my portfolio up a notch!
This is my 1st attempt at a Ruby on Rails app and it seems to have been quite successful!

<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> is a programming language that allows you to create objects and make them do things using coded programs or programmatically.

Additionally, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Rails</a> is the framework that sets up a lovely development environment, runs your Ruby programs and connects your app to a database management system (DBMS) (ex. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> ) alot faster. Finally, it makes the development workflow more efficient than any other framework I have ever seen.

I'm using <a href="https://www.terraform.io" target="_blank">Terraform</a> for Infrastructure as Code (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/use-cases/infrastructure-as-code" target="_blank">IaC</a>) and an <a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> Linux operating system <a href="https://www.linode.com" target="_blank">Linode</a> for hosting.
