I built this [website](https://rails-blog.terencehamilton.com) because I wanted to match the skills listed on a job posting I saw recently. Also, I saw this as an opportunity to kick my portfolio up a notch!
This is my 1st attempt at a Ruby on Rails app and it seems to have been quite successful!

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a programming language that allows you to create objects and make them do things using coded programs or programmatically.

Additionally, [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) is the framework that sets up a lovely development environment, runs your Ruby programs and connects your app to a database management system (DBMS) (ex. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) ) alot faster. Finally, it makes the development workflow more efficient than any other framework I have ever seen.

I'm using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) for Infrastructure as Code ([IaC](https://www.terraform.io/use-cases/infrastructure-as-code)) and an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) Linux operating system (OS) running on [Linode](https://www.linode.com) for hosting.
